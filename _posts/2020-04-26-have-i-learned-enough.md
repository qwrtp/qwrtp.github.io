So here we are, a little over a month in to the lockdown, and the time has come to take stock.

All around, at least as far as the media are concerned, a tragedy is unfolding, yet here in my East London bedroom cum studio cum office all seems relatively calm. In fact, as my 70+ year old father pointed out to me yesterday, lockdown and retirement have much in common. If only I could feel as positive about the current situation and its effect on my future as my father feels about his retirement.
